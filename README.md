reasons. According to the data compiled by the team behind
the Medina bike sharing map, there are currently over 3,000
bike share systems in cities around the globe Bike sharing
systems are a means of renting bicycles where the process of
obtaining membership, rental, and bike return is automated via
a network of kiosk locations throughout a city. Using these
systems, people are able rent a bike from a one location and
return it to a different place on an as-needed basis.

flexibility, reductions to vehicle emissions, health benefits,
reduced congestion and fuel consumption, and financial savings
for individuals.
